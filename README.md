## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your n8n installation directory:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_TYPE=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=n8n
DB_USERNAME=n8n_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# External Service APIs
SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-your-slack-token
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your-gmail-client-id
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-gmail-client-secret
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.com/webhook

# Notification Settings
ALERT_EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com
ERROR_WEBHOOK=https://your-error-tracking-service.com/webhook
```

### Credential Setup

Each workflow includes a `CREDENTIALS.md` file with detailed setup instructions for required services:

- **OAuth Applications** - Google, Microsoft, Slack, etc.
- **API Keys** - Third-party services and databases
- **Webhook URLs** - For triggering and receiving data
- **Database Connections** - Connection strings and credentials

```

## 📋 Workflow Templates

### Template Structure

Each workflow follows a consistent structure:

```
workflow-name/
├── workflow.json           # Main n8n workflow file
├── README.md              # Workflow-specific documentation
├── CREDENTIALS.md         # Required credentials setup
├── config.json           # Configuration parameters
├── test-data/            # Sample data for testing
│   ├── input-sample.json
│   └── output-sample.json
└── screenshots/          # Workflow screenshots
    ├── overview.png
    └── configuration.png
```

### Quick Import Guide

1. **Choose a workflow** from the categories above
2. **Read the README** for that specific workflow
3. **Set up credentials** as described in CREDENTIALS.md
4. **Import the workflow.json** file into n8n
5. **Configure parameters** using the provided config.json
6. **Test with sample data** before going live

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Workflow Design

- **Keep it simple**: Start with basic workflows and add complexity gradually
- **Error handling**: Always include error handling nodes and fallback paths
- **Logging**: Add logging for debugging and monitoring purposes
- **Testing**: Test with sample data before deploying to production

### Security

- **Credential management**: Use n8n's built-in credential system
- **API rate limits**: Implement delays to respect API rate limits
- **Data validation**: Validate input data to prevent injection attacks
- **Access control**: Limit workflow access to authorized users only

### Performance

- **Batch processing**: Process multiple items together when possible
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data to reduce API calls
- **Monitoring**: Monitor workflow execution times and resource usage
- **Optimization**: Regularly review and optimize workflow performance

### Maintenance

- **Version control**: Keep track of workflow changes
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation
- **Backup**: Regular backup of workflows and data
- **Updates**: Keep n8n and integrations updated

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Workflow Not Triggering

**Symptoms**: Workflow doesn't start when expected

**Solutions**:
- Check trigger configuration (webhook URL, schedule settings)
- Verify credentials are valid and not expired
- Check n8n logs for error messages
- Test trigger manually using the "Test Workflow" button

#### API Rate Limiting

**Symptoms**: "Rate limit exceeded" errors

**Solutions**:
- Add delay nodes between API calls
- Implement exponential backoff
- Use batch processing where available
- Check API documentation for rate limits

#### Memory Issues

**Symptoms**: Workflow fails with memory errors

**Solutions**:
- Process data in smaller batches
- Use streaming for large datasets
- Optimize data transformations
- Increase n8n memory allocation

#### Credential Errors

**Symptoms**: "Authentication failed" or "Invalid credentials"

**Solutions**:
- Refresh OAuth tokens
- Verify API keys are correct
- Check credential permissions
- Test credentials outside of n8n

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:

```bash
# Set environment variable
N8N_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Or in n8n interface
Settings → Log Level → Debug
```
